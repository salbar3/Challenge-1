# Challenge-1

I refactored the given html code for the Horiseon website to make it more semantic.

I changed several div elements and made the the title element in the head something more specific to the Horiseon brand.

The elements that I changed in index.html no longer matched what was written in style.css file so I adjusted that so they would matched again. 

I added alt descriptions to every img.

I also added some notes over every section of the html and css files to help organzie the code.

I hope everything is how you would like it.
